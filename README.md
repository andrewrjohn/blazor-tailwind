# Blazor + Tailwind

A match made in heaven, maybe. BUnit included.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to start using this is to install the dotnet template:

```bash
dotnet new -i Blazor.TailwindCSS.BUnit
```

Then you can bootstrap a new app using the installed template:

```bash
dotnet new blazortailwind -o my-app --name MyApp
```

There you have it! You now have a brand-new Blazor server app that's using TailwindCSS and BUnit ðŸŽ‰

## Running the App

Go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd my-app
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
  dotnet restore
  cd MyApp
  yarn # or you can use 'npm install'
```

Start the server:

```bash
  dotnet watch run --project MyApp
```

View app at https://localhost:5001 ðŸŽ‰

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command from the solution root directory:

```bash
  dotnet test MyApp.Tests
```

or to run from the test project directory:

```bash
  cd MyApp.Tests
  dotnet test
```
